## Retailer Churn Analysis & Retention Strategy
*(BCG RISE 2.0 Capstone Project – Group Project)*

### Business Problem
Between 2021 and 2024, the number of active retailers declined significantly,
increasing revenue concentration risk. The objective of this project was to
identify retailers at risk of churn and support targeted retention strategies
using data-driven insights.

### My Role & Contributions
- Cleaned and prepared raw transactional data for analysis
- Performed feature engineering for customer segmentation
- Implemented machine learning code to segment retailers based on behavior
- Supported downstream churn analysis with model-ready datasets

### Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Machine learning for customer segmentation
- Jupyter Notebook

### Key Outcomes
- Identified distinct retailer segments with varying churn risk
- Enabled early detection of disengagement patterns
- Supported data-driven retention strategy design
